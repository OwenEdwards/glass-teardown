    <h2>What is this Glass thing anyways?</h2>
    <p>Google's latest and hottest gadget needs little introduction. Since its public unveiling in April 2012, the tiny head-mounted Android computer has been <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/13/183468218/google-fights-glass-backlash-before-it-even-hits-the-street">causing controversy</a> and subjected to much <a href="http://whitemenwearinggoogleglass.tumblr.com">sociological analysis</a>. It is currently available in limited beta to eminent members of the tech community and to a selection of "Glass Explorers".</p>

    <p>Growing up on a rich diet of dystopic tech fiction, we were filled by an equal mix of intrigue and concern about Glass and decided to take our model apart to bring you the first detailed view into the electronics guts of the device.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Gargoyles represent the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporation. Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them. Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society.</em></p>

    <p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/what-is-prism-511875267">In light of recent events</a> it is more important than ever to be aware and conscious of privacy implications of the technology we use.  Glass is a touchpoint device and we aim here to reveal its interior to those who would do good for the world with this information.  We also live in an age when more and more of our technology is made inaccessible to the people who use it, to either understand, repair, or reuse, and other activities that one would normally associate with "ownership."</p>

    <h1>The Receiving Ceremony</h1>

    <p>Glass Explorers first receive an invitation to purchase Glass online, then must schedule an in-person pickup appointment at one of three "Glass Studio" in Mountain View, Los Angeles, or New York. At this appointment, a trained staff walks you through the setup and usage of your Glass unit.</p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="screenshots/glass-site-thankyou-crop.png" alt="">

    <p>We arrived a little early for the appointment Sunday afternoon at the Mountain View google campus, and found a good sized group of people mingling on the lawn in front of Google's Glass building, most already wearing Glass units, setting a scene somewhere between a garden party and a camera-wielding press mob.</p>

<p>Inside, in a space called "The Garage", a temporary retail-showroom-like space had been set up with tables, stools, and mirror stands, where staff members walked Glass Explorers through the software features of their new face computers.</p>

    <p>At the door, a friendly greeter took us into the Glass Studio, offered us mimosas, and showed us to the device color selection wall, with models in Charcoal, Tangerine, Shale, Cotton, Sky.</p> 

    <p>Forty-five minutes of Glass user interface training followed, including setup, phone pairing, and linking google accounts. We were also shown how to re-bond Glass with another phone later, by resetting to AC adapter</li>
      <li>USB cable</li>
      <li>Soft case</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Hardware Teardown</h1>

    <p>We eagerly brought Glass back to the lab to begin the dissection.  Speculation reigned: what if the entire body of Glass is potted with epoxy requiring strong solvents to access?  Which part is the battery in?  How hackable is this thing?  Where are the sensors?  Any extra hardware features yet to be unlocked by future software updates?  But first, where to even begin opening it?</p>
