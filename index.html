    <h2>What is this Glass thing anyways?</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Gargoyles represent the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporation. Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them. Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society.</em></p>

    <p>Google's latest and hottest gadget needs no introduction. Since its public unveiling in April 2012, the tiny head-mounted Android computer has been adorning the faces of a <a href="http://whitemenwearinggoogleglass.tumblr.com">diverse range of people</a>, and has been <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/13/183468218/google-fights-glass-backlash-before-it-even-hits-the-street">widely accepted by the general public</a>. Fortunately, they've made it relatively easy to obtain one--relative to the ease of obtaining a nuclear warhead, that is--which is why we're able to bring you the first detailed view into the electronics guts of the device.</p>

    <h1>The Receiving Ceremony</h1>

    <p>Glass is such a special device that typical physical shipment is not sufficient. Instead, you must schedule an in-person pickup appointment at a "Glass Studio" in Mountain View, Los Angeles, or New York. At this appointment, a trained staff will walk you through the setup and usage of your Glass unit.</p>

    <p>After receiving an initial invitation, Glass Explorers get to make an appointment online.</p>

    <img class="image-bordered image-centered" src="screenshots/glass-site-thankyou-crop.png" alt="">

    <p>We arrived a little early for the appointment Sunday afternoon at the Mountain View google campus, and found a good sized group of people mingling on the lawn in front of Google's Glass building.  Most of them Google employees already wearing Glass units, so the feeling was somewhere between the familiarity of showing up to a party in someone's backyard, and the intimidation of walking up to a press corps with its cameras out.</p>

    <p>At the door, a friendly greeter took us into the Glass Studio, offered us mimosas, and showed us to the color selection wall.</p> 

    <p>Forty-five minutes of Glass user interface training followed, including setup and pairing with my phone.  Notably, it was mentioned that one can bond Glass with another phone later by resetting to Factory condtions</p>

    <p>Our Glass pickup appointment took place in a Google space called "The Garage". We arrived a little early Sunday afternoon at the Mountain View google campus, and found a good sized group of people strolling the lawn in front of the building. Inside, a temporary retail-showroom-like space had been set up, with tables for staff members to walk Glass explorers through the software features of their new toy.</p>
